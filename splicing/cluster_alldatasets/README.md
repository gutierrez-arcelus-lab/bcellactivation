## Comparison between Scharer et al and Barnas et al

### Highest absolute PSI per gene

### Smallest nominal p-value per gene

\* dashed line corresponds to -log10(0.05)

## GO enrichment

GO enrichment analysis for genes with at least one cluster with adjusted
p-value &lt; 0.1 in the Scharer dataset.
